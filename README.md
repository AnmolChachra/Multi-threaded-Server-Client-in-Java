# Multi-threaded-Server-Client-in-Java
This project is an easy A in any Operating System assignment!
I have used multithreading, threadpools, and optimized request-response mechanism to create a powerful server.
I have uploaded some clients.
Try to run the clients one after the other. There is a delay imposed in each request to server so that the use of threadpool is clear to the viewer.

Software requirements: Eclipse or NetBeans, java 8 or above.
